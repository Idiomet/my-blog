<p>In todayâ€™s blog post, I will be going over the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The AWS CLI can be a faster alternative to utilizing the different services that AWS has to offer, when compared to using the browser-based AWS Management Console. Whatâ€™s great about the AWS CLI is that it offers flexibility of running different commands through Linux shells, Windows command line, and running remote commands through SSH. Every single function thatâ€™s available in the AWS Management Console is also available to be used in the CLI.</p>
