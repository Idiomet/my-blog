<p>HTTP messages are how a server and a client can communicate data with each other. A server is a remote computer providing data, while a client is a local computer requesting data from the server.</p>

<p>There are two types of HTTP messages, which are requests and responses. A request is sent by the client to either send or retrieve data to the server. A response is the reply or answer back from the server, in response to a request. These two types of messages are made of ASCII text and can have multiple lines of text.</p>

<h2 id="http-message-structure">HTTP Message Structure</h2>
<p>Head of an HTTP Message:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start-line: Describes the request to be made or the status of the response</li>
  <li>Headers: Specify the request or describes details about the body of the message.</li>
  <li>Blank line to indicate the end of the above metadata</li>
</ol>
