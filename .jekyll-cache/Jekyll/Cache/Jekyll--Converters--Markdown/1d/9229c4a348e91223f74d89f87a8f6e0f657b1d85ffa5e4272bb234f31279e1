<p>Hello, my name is Josh Castillo and I will be going over Git. I will also explain why it can be useful for projects and also go over basic Git commands based on notes I jotted down from the GitHub doc and YouTube videos. This post will also serve an additional purpose by solidifying my knowledge on these two subjects.</p>
