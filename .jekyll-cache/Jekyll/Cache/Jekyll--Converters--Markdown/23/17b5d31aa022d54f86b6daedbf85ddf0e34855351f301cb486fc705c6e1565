<p>HTTP messages are how a server and a client can communicate data with each other on the web. A server is a remote computer providing data, while a client is a local computer requesting data from the server.</p>

<p>There are two types of HTTP messages, which are requests and responses. A request is sent by the client to either send or retrieve data to the server. A response is the reply or answer back from the server, in response to a request. These two types of messages are made of ASCII text and can have multiple lines of text.</p>

<h2 id="http-message-structure">HTTP Message Structure</h2>
<p>Head of an HTTP Message:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start-line: Describes the request to be made or the status of the response</li>
  <li>Headers: Specify the request or describes details about the body of the message.</li>
  <li>Blank line to indicate the end of the above metadata</li>
</ol>

<p>Payload:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Optional body containing data associated with the request or response</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="http-requests">HTTP Requests</h2>
<p>HTTP requests are messages sent by the client to either send or retrieve data from a server.</p>

<h3 id="start-line">Start-line</h3>
<p>The start-line (first line) in the request contains the following three elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>HTTP method such as GET or POST that describes the action to be performed
    <ul>
      <li>GET method retrieves data from a server</li>
      <li>POST method sends data to a server accompanied by a payload</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Request target which is usually a URL</li>
  <li>HTTP version which defines which version of HTTP to use</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="headers">Headers</h3>
<p>There are 3 groups of headers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>General headers which apply to the whole message, the head and the payload.</li>
  <li>Request headers which modify the request itself.</li>
  <li>Entity headers which apply to only the body of the request.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="body">Body</h3>
<p>The last part of the request is the body. Not all requests are required to have one, but it is required for requests that are sending data such as requests using the POST method. It is used to indicate what data is being sent. There are two types of bodies. The first type of body is single-resource bodies, which consist of one single file. The second type of body is multiple-resource bodies, which consist of multiple parts.</p>
