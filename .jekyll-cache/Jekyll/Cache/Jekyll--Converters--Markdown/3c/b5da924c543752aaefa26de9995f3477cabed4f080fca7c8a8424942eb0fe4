<!-- Brief Intro -->
<p>Today, I will be going over how to launch an incredibly useful service from Amazon Web Services, which are EC2 instances. EC2 instances allow you to deploy virtual servers in the cloud, backed with Amazon‚Äôs reliable network infrastructure and fast speeds. Because of EC2‚Äôs scalability, you can increase or decrease your computing needs on demand within minutes. With a 99.99% guaranteed uptime, you can expect to rely on EC2 instances from a day to day basis. In addition to near 24/7 uptime, Amazon allows you to configure your EC2 computing instance to however you like with various CPU, storage, network, and operating system options to choose from. In terms of security of EC2 instances, they are supported by the AWS Nitro System which offloads many of the virtualization resources to dedicated hardware and software, which minimizes the total number of entry points an attacker can target.</p>

<!-- Use Cases -->
