<p>Let me give you a brief introduction on Terraform and then later on I will give over how to automate the deployment of two AWS servers using Terraform. Terraform is a free and open-source tool that allows you to automate and manage infrastructure such as web servers or database servers with different cloud providers. These providers include AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. The great thing about Terraform is that it is just like Ansible, where it uses a declarative language. You specify your desired end result and Terraform will automatically figure out the steps in between to achieve that end result. Essentially, this allows you to create a blueprint of what you want your infrastructure to be. Another great thing about Terraform is that before your infrastructure is created, it will create an execution plan, which will create a preview of what changes will be made. Next, Iâ€™ll be going over how to install Terraform on Ubuntu.</p>
