<p>So first off, what is Ansible? It is an extremely useful tool to automate the process of managing servers at scale. No programming is necessary to learn how to use Ansible, because Ansible has built in modules that will do all the heavy programming for you. All thatâ€™s needed for Ansible to work is for the host machines to have SSH and Python installed. Whatâ€™s also great is that Python works on any operating system such as Linux, Windows, and Mac.</p>
