<p>You may be wondering what is Samba? Samba is a software package that provides stable and fast file, folder, and printer sharing between Windows and Linux computers. It can also act as a domain controller just like Active Directory which handles authentication requests on a domain. It is useful for a corporate network to quickly and easily share sensitive files and folders between users on the local network, without risk of exposure to the outside world.</p>
