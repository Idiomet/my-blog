<p>Hello, my name is Josh Castillo and I will be going over Git and explain why it can be useful for projects and also go over basic Git commands based on notes I wrote down from the GitHub docs and YouTube videos on how to use Git and GitHub. This will also serve as another purpose by solidifying my knowledge on these two subjects.</p>
