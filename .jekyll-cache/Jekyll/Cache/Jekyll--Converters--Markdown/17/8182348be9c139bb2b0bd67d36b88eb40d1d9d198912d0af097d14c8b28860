<p>You may ask, what is a proxy server? Well, a proxy server is a server that acts as a middleman for internet requests. In other words, a client host will send a request to a proxy server, and then the proxy server will get the response back from the server host, and then pass the response back along to the client host. Some of the uses of a proxy server include content-filtering, bypassing content restrictions or censorship, and privacy or anonymity. To provide more context on how proxies are used for privacy, when you connect to the web using a proxy server, your home IP address is not shown publicly, but instead your proxy server IP address is shown publicly.</p>
