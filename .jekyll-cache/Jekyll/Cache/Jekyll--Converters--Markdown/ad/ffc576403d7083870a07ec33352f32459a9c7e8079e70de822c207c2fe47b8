<p>Hello, in todayâ€™s blog post Iâ€™m going to be going over Docker. Docker is an incredibly useful tool to quickly deploy applications in an isolated environment with very little computing resource overhead. Docker uses the hostâ€™s operating system resources to create containerized applications. Docker is a bit similar to virtual machines, because they both virtualize a layer of a computer. Virtual machines virtualize the hardware layer of a computer, while Docker virtualizes the operating system layer of a computer. By virtualizing the operating system layer, it allows whatever applications or containers thatâ€™s run on Docker to be ran on any host operating system without any trouble.</p>
