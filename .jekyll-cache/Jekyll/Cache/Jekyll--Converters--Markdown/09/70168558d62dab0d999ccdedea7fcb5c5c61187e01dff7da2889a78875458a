<p>HTTP messages are how a server and a client can communicate data with each other. A server is a remote computer providing data, while a client is a local computer requesting data from the server.</p>

<p>There are two types of HTTP messages, which are requests and responses. A request is sent by the client to either send or retrieve data to the server. A response is the reply or answer back from the server, in response to a request.</p>
