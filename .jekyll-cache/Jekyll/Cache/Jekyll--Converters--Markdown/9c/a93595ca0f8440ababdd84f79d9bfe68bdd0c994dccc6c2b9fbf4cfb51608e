I"Ã<p>Hello, my name is Joshua, but I prefer to be called Josh. I am currently a graduating Senior at <a href="https://www.csun.edu/">CSUN</a> majoring in Computer Information Technology and minoring in Geographic Information Systems. I love learning new programming languages or any topics related to computing. Also as a side business I resell limited edition shoes and clothing.</p>
