<h2 id="intro-on-aws-cli">Intro on AWS CLI</h2>
<p>In today’s blog post, I will be going over the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The AWS CLI can be a faster alternative to utilizing the different services that AWS has to offer, when compared to using the browser-based AWS Management Console. What’s great about the AWS CLI is that it offers flexibility of running different commands through Linux shells, Windows command line, and running remote commands through SSH. Every single function that’s available in the AWS Management Console is also available to be used in the CLI.</p>

<h2 id="installing-aws-cli-on-windows">Installing AWS CLI on Windows</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi">AWS Installer</a> for Windows.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions until you finish installing the program.</li>
  <li>To verify if the installation was successful you can run the following command:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws --version</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="configuring-the-aws-cli">Configuring the AWS CLI</h2>
<p>Next, we’re going to configure the AWS CLI to connect it to our AWS account. But first, we need to get our access key ID and secret access key from the AWS Management Console. These keys will give the CLI root-level access to our account.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sign into your AWS account.</li>
  <li>Go to the IAM section in the AWS Console: <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users</a></li>
  <li>Click on the user that you want to connect to the AWS CLI.</li>
  <li>Click “Security credentials” tab.</li>
  <li>Click “Create access key”.</li>
  <li>Copy the “Access key ID” and “Secret access key” into somewhere safe. We will be using them later.</li>
  <li>Open up a command prompt and enter the following command: 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws configure</code></li>
  <li>Input your access key ID that we saved earlier. Hit Enter.</li>
  <li>Input your secret access key that we saved earlier. Hit Enter.</li>
  <li>Input the following text to set North California as the default region.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-west-1</code></li>
  <li>Leave the default output format blank.</li>
  <li>Congrats! Now you’ve properly configured the AWS CLI to connect with your AWS account.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I will be going over how to create an Ubuntu 18.04 t2.micro instance using the AWS CLI.</p>
