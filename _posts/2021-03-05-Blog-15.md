## Terraform with Powershell Automation
Have you ever deployed multiple EC2 instances using Terraform and went through the trouble of turning off "IE Enhanced Security Configuration" for each instance because you want to browse the rest of the web? Or have you ever wanted a way to automate the installation of Chrome, and runtimes such as Java JDK, .NET Framework, Silverlight, and Adobe Air in each EC2 instance? Well, then this blog post is perfect for you because today I will be going over how to do all of the above using Powershell scripts that will be run on startup for each instance deployed using Terraform.

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "ec2_botting_instances" {
  ami             = "ami-02b5cd5aa444bee23"
  instance_type   = "c5d.2xlarge"
  count           = 3 # Change number to how many instances you need
  key_name        = "AWS_KeyPair"
  security_groups = ["Botting_Security_Group"]

  # Powershell script to disable IE Enhanced Security and Download all Bot Files
  user_data = file("Disable_IE_&_Download_Bots.ps1")

  tags = {
    Name = "Botting Setup"
  }
}
```
