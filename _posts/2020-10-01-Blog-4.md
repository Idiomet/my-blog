This dynamic content is generated from server-side scripting languages such as PHP and ASP. When a website is dynamic, it allows for more customization and functionality than a static website.

## What is Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 is a cloud-based storage solution offered by AWS. You have the ability to store files or objects in the cloud, which allows high availability and low latency access to your files. It can also be used for storing data for backups and disaster recovery.
