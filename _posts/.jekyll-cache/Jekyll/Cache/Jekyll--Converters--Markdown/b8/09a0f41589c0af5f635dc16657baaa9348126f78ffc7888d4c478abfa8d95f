<p>Imagine disabling the network adapter of an AWS Lightsail instance, because you thought doing so would fix your Internet connection? Well, that exact scenario happened to me today. After I disabled the network adapter, I was immediately disconnected from the RDP session. So, I tried reconnecting again and it was not connecting. Then, I tried restarting the instance from the Lightsail dashboard, and then connecting again afterwards, and I still was not able to connect to the instance. Afterwards I knew there was no way of reconnecting to the Lightsail instance, because what I did was essentially cut off network access of the instance to the AWS infrastructure. Ultimately, I did have some important files on my instance that I needed to recover, so here are the steps I went through to successfully recover my files.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have the latest AWS CLI version 2 installed and configured.</li>
  <li>Run the following command in your terminal:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws lightsail create-disk-snapshot --region REGION_NAME_HERE --instance-name INSTANCE_NAME_HERE --disk-snapshot-name NAME_OF_DISK_HERE</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace REGION_NAME_HERE with the region where your instance is located in.</li>
      <li>Replace INSTANCE_NAME_HERE with the name of the instance that you want to create the disk snapshot from.</li>
      <li>Replace NAME_OF_DISK_HERE with the name of the new disk that we are creating.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After the snapshot is created, go to your Lightsail dashboard and go to the â€œSnapshotsâ€ tab.</li>
  <li>Your newly created snapshot will be under the â€œDisk Snapshotsâ€ category.</li>
  <li>From the disk snapshot, we need to create a new disk. Click on the 3 dots next to the disk snapshot and select â€œCreate new diskâ€.</li>
  <li>For the availability zone, make sure to select the same zone as your instance. Afterwards, click â€œCreate diskâ€.</li>
  <li>Next, we need to create a new instance to attach the disk to it.</li>
  <li>Create a new Lightsail instance with the same availability zone as the disk , or else it wonâ€™t work. Also make sure you choose the same instance image and instance plan as your no longer working instance.</li>
  <li>Next, letâ€™s attach the disk to the instance. Go to the Storage tab, and click on the disk we created. Select the instance we just created and click on Attach.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="making-the-disk-accessible-on-windows">Making the Disk Accessible on Windows</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Connect to your Lightsail instance through RDP by clicking on the computer monitor icon.</li>
  <li>After youâ€™re connected, click on the Start menu and type in â€œDisk Managementâ€.</li>
  <li>Right click on the disk that you attached to this instance. The label will say â€œOfflineâ€. Now select â€œOnlineâ€.</li>
  <li>The label should now say â€œOnlineâ€ and now youâ€™ve successfully recovered your old instanceâ€™s files and made them accessible through the File Explorer.</li>
</ol>
