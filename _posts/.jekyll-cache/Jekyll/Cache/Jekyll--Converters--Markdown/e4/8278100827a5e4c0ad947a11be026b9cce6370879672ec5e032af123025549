<p>For this week, as part of my frontend developer role in the team, I explored an extremely useful web app called Figma. Currently, I’ve been using Figma to help design our team’s web page for our group project. What is Figma you may ask? Well, Figma is a web-based design and prototyping tool for web developers. It is very similar to Adobe Illustrator, which allows you to create vector-based graphics, but with Figma, it’s just like Illustrator, but more tailored to frontend developers. It’s easily accessible from any device as long as you have a web browser and what makes it so unique is that it allows live collaboration with other frontend developers on your team. So in other words, you have the ability to make changes and edits in real-time with the rest of your team.</p>

<h2 id="why-figma">Why Figma?</h2>
<p>Have you ever finished coding an HTML page with CSS, but it didn’t exactly look as to how you envisioned it? Well, Figma solves that problem because essentially you design that UI/UX within Figma itself without having to go through the trouble of actually coding everything first. Then, once you design how you want your UI/UX to look within Figma, you can then use it as a visual guide of how you want your HTML page to look. What’s even greater is that Figma provides accompanying CSS code for each element that you created. See below for an example:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/Figma_CSS.PNG" alt="Figma CSS" /></p>

<p>From here, you can copy and paste the code into the CSS for your own page and it will look exactly the same for that element, but make sure to use the correct CSS selectors. Now you’re well on your way to creating the perfect user interface that you truly envisioned!</p>
