Hello, my name is Joshua, but I prefer to be called Josh. I am currently a graduating Senior at [CSUN] majoring in Computer Information Technology and minoring in Geographic Information Systems. I love learning new programming languages or any topics related to computing. Also, as a side business I resell limited edition shoes and clothing.
