Hello, welcome to my blog! My name is Josh. I am a graduate from California State University, Northridge (CSUN), where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Technology and a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). My passion for technology began at a young age, when I first took an introductory computer class at the age of 11. In that class, I was introduced to the basics of touch typing and using Microsoft applications such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. This sparked my interest in the world of technology, and I found myself spending hours on the computer reading and learning about various different topics related to technology. I was fascinated by the vast capabilities of computers and the endless possibilities they offer.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also developed a keen interest in the world of e-commerce. I have been reselling limited edition shoes and clothing using automation software such as sneaker bots, while also utilizing cloud infrastructure to reduce latency. This has allowed me to gain valuable experience in the field of e-commerce, and I am always looking for new and innovative ways to improve my skills in this area.

On this blog, you will find posts that I've written about the different technologies and topics that I have learned throughout my senior year of college. This blog was created using Jekyll, a static site generator that uses Markdown, HTML, and CSS to quickly create blog posts. Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and experience with others, and to inspire others to pursue their own passions in the field of technology.
