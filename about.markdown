Hello, my name is Josh. I am a CSUN graduate with a B.S. in Computer Information Technology and a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I've always been fascinated by computers at an early age, ever since I took an introductory computer class at the age of 11. In that class, we were taught how to touch type, use various Microsoft applications such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. After that class, I would often find myself spending hours on the computer just reading and learning about new topics, and I was always so amazed at the capabilities of what the computer can do. With a computer, the world is literally at your fingertips. Also, as a way to make extra money, I resell limited edition shoes and clothing using automation software such as sneaker bots while also utilizing cloud infrastructure to reduce latency.

In this blog, you will find my posts that I've written about the different technologies and topics that I have learned throughout my senior year of college. This blog was created using Jekyll, which is a static site generator for easily creating blogs.
